## Usage
### Get the repo
Run the following command in the directory you would like the project to reside in.

`git clone https://github.com/Kashyap98/comp383_miniproject.git`
### Run controller.py
controller.py is the center of the entire operation. 

NOTE: If you have multiple versions of python installed on your system replace the `python` part of the commands with `python3`.

Identify the args necessary for the smooth operation of this miniproject pipeline.

`python controller.py -h`
#### Args:
`--name [name]`: (Required) The name of your test folder and log file inside the folder. miniProject_[name]

`--test_data [y\n]`: (Default: y) Determine if you should download the full sra files or use the sample test data provided. y uses sample test data while n downloads new sra files. 

`--quiet [y\n]`: (Default: n) Determine if logger should also output to terminal in addition to the log file generated in the test folder. y does not output to terminal while n outputs to both log file and terminal.

### Run cleaner.py

If you have too many test folders created you can run `python cleaner.py` to remove the test folders. It will prompt you with a 'y' or 'n' confirmation of folder deletion (this is irreversible).
